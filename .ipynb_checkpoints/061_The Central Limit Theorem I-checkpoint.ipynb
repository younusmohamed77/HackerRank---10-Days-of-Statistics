    "#### Task\n",
    "A large elevator can transport a maximum of 9800 pounds. Suppose a load of cargo containing 49 boxes must be transported via the elevator. The box weight of this type of cargo follows a distribution with a mean of mu = 205 pounds and a standard deviation of sigma = 15 pounds. Based on this information, what is the probability that all 49 boxes can be safely loaded into the freight elevator and transported?\n",
